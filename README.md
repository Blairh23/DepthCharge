JS13KGame - 2017 entry
Depth Charge, my entry into the 2017 JS13KGame competition. I have to be honest, this was a lot harder than I thought it would be, from computer issues to coding this completion had it all.

This is my first foray into any sort of game jam, and being the size limit it was a challenge. JavaScript is not my best language, I have coded a game or two in it before, one a pong type game using pure JavaScript and a platform type game using a game engine.

My game Depth Charge is a stretch for the theme of “Lost”, but to be frank I went down a rabbit whole and before I knew it the “Lost theme was being stretched.

I hope in the near future to review the JS13K games that have been submitted and learn from them.

My game is pure HTML5, CSS and JavaScript in a single file, I did this on purpose because I thought a single file would be easier to control.
